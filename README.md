# herdr-jira

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of [a2u/herdr-jira](https://github.com/a2u/herdr-jira). The
> upstream plugin provides the Jira terminal pane described below. This fork
> adds a native Jira issue list to the Herdr sidebar and pairs with the custom
> [`vatsa31/herdr`](https://github.com/vatsa31/herdr) host fork.

## what this fork adds

The original plugin opens Jira as a full terminal pane. This fork preserves that
TUI—including filters, issue details, transitions, and agent delegation—and
also makes the user's open issues visible while they work elsewhere in Herdr.

                                  Click → exact issue details
```

The fork adds:

- a headless `herdr-jira resource --id my-issues` JSON provider that reuses the
  existing Jira client, authentication, and JQL configuration;
- a configurable `[sidebar]` section with named-filter selection and a safe
  open-issues fallback;
- automatic refresh through Herdr, truthful truncation/count metadata, mock
  scenarios, and control-character sanitization;
- exact-issue activation that opens or reuses a single Jira pane; and
- sequenced request delivery so rapid selections resolve to the latest issue.

The provider work is documented in
[PR #1](https://github.com/vatsa31/herdr-jira/pull/1). Its companion generic
host support is in
[`vatsa31/herdr` PR #1](https://github.com/vatsa31/herdr/pull/1), with sidebar
interaction fixes in
[`vatsa31/herdr` PR #2](https://github.com/vatsa31/herdr/pull/2). The combined
flow has been validated with mock data on Linux and real Jira data on Apple
Silicon macOS, including issue loading, detail opening, and pane reuse.

### use this fork

Install the custom Herdr host first, then install this plugin fork:

```bash
herdr plugin install vatsa31/herdr-jira
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vatsa31/herdr-jira.git
cd herdr-jira
cargo build --release --locked
herdr plugin link "$PWD"
```

Existing `herdr-jira` configuration and `api_token_cmd` credentials continue to
work. The sidebar defaults to the first configured filter, or to unresolved
issues assigned to the current user when no filter exists. An optional named
filter can be selected without duplicating JQL:

```toml
[sidebar]
enabled = true
title = "My Jira issues"
filter = "My open issues"
```

For credential-free development, run the provider with
`HERDR_JIRA_MOCK=1`. The stock Herdr release can still run the pane and actions,
but it cannot display the native sidebar section.

## original plugin

A Jira TUI that lives in a [herdr](https://herdr.dev) pane: browse issues through
configurable JQL filters, search, change issue status, and delegate an issue to
any AI agent in herdr with one key — pick a running agent, or start a new one
in a chosen directory. The agent receives a prompt built from a configurable
template (issue key, summary, description, link, …).

```

```

## Features

- **Filters** — named JQL filters from the config (`f` or `1`–`9`): my issues,
  a specific project, anything JQL can express.
- **Search** — `/` runs a `text ~ "…"` search (template configurable), and `J`
  runs any raw JQL you type, prefilled with the current query for quick tweaks.
- **Epics** — epics stand out with a magenta type badge and a `▸` marker;
  `→` expands one inline to show its child issues (`parent = …`, with a
  `"Epic Link"` fallback for Server/DC), `←` collapses it.
- **Issue details** — `Enter` opens a scrollable view with the description
  (Cloud ADF documents are flattened to plain text).
- **Status transitions** — `s` lists the transitions available for the issue
  and applies the one you pick.
- **Delegate to an agent** — `d` lists agents currently running in herdr
  (claude, codex, grok, …) with status and cwd; pick one and the issue is sent
  as a prompt from your `[delegate].prompt` template and submitted server-side
  (configurable). Or choose **+ start new agent…** (`n`) to pick an agent type
  and working directory — herdr runs it via `pane run` and the same Jira
  prompt is sent as soon as the agent is ready.

Works with Jira Cloud (email + API token) and Jira Server / Data Center
(personal access token). Cloud's newer `/rest/api/2/search/jql` endpoint is
used when available, with automatic fallback to the classic `/rest/api/2/search`.

## Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first command below installs the upstream, pane-only plugin. Use
> [this fork's installation](#use-this-fork) for the sidebar provider.

Requires herdr **0.8.0+** and a Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs) at install time.

```sh
herdr plugin install a2u/herdr-jira
```

or for local development:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:a2u/herdr-jira.git
herdr plugin link ./herdr-jira
```

## Configure

```sh
mkdir -p "$(herdr plugin config-dir herdr-jira)"
cp config.example.toml "$(herdr plugin config-dir herdr-jira)/config.toml"
```

Edit `config.toml`:

```toml
[jira]
base_url = "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net"
auth = "basic"                      # "bearer" for Server/DC PAT
email = "you@company.com"
api_token_cmd = "security find-generic-password -s jira-api-token -w"
default_project = "PROJ"

[[filters]]
name = "My open issues"
jql = "assignee = currentUser() AND resolution = Unresolved ORDER BY updated DESC"

[[filters]]
name = "Project board"
jql = "project = {project} AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY updated DESC"

[delegate]
prompt = """
You are asked to work on Jira issue {key}: {summary}
Link: {url}

Description:
{description}
"""
submit = true          # submit server-side; false only pastes the text

# default_cwd = "~/Work"
placement = "tab"      # "tab" | "right" | "down"
focus_new = false
startup_delay_ms = 1500
wait_ready_ms = 30000

# Agents you can spawn from the delegate picker ("+ start new agent…")
[[delegate.agents]]
name = "claude"
command = ["claude"]

[[delegate.agents]]
name = "codex"
command = ["codex"]

[[delegate.agents]]
name = "grok"
command = ["grok"]
```

For Jira Cloud, create an API token at
<https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens> and store it in
the macOS Keychain so it never touches the config file:

```sh
security add-generic-password -s jira-api-token -a "$USER" -w '<TOKEN>'
```

The running pane reloads the config on `R`.

## Open the pane

From the herdr action palette: **Jira: open (split)** or **Jira: open (tab)** —
or bind a key in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`:

```toml
[[keys.command]]              # open in a split beside your work
key = "prefix+j"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "herdr-jira.open-jira"

[[keys.command]]              # …or in its own tab
key = "prefix+shift+j"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "herdr-jira.open-jira-tab"
```

(then `herdr server reload-config`)

## Keys

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j`/`k`, `↑`/`↓` | move / scroll |
| `Enter` | open issue details |
| `→`/`l`, `←`/`h` | expand / collapse an epic (shows its child issues inline) |
| `f`, `1`–`9` | switch filter |
| `/` | search |
| `J` | run a custom JQL query (prefilled with the current one) |
| `s` | change issue status |
| `d` | delegate issue to a running agent, or start a new one |
| `n` | in the delegate picker: start a new agent |
| `1`–`9` | quick pick inside any popup (agents, transitions, filters) |
| `o` | open issue in the browser |
| `r` | refresh current filter |
| `R` | reload config |
| `?` | help |
| `q` | quit |

## Delegate prompt placeholders

`{key}` `{summary}` `{description}` `{url}` `{status}` `{assignee}`
`{reporter}` `{priority}` `{type}` `{labels}`

With `submit = true`, `herdr agent prompt <pane-id> <text>` delivers and
submits the prompt server-side, avoiding a race between pasted text and Enter.
With `submit = false`, `herdr pane send-text <pane-id> <text>` only pastes the
text. The legacy `submit_delay_ms` setting is accepted but no longer used.
Delivery errors are shown without retrying through raw input, to avoid duplicate
prompts or typing into a startup dialog.

### Starting a new agent

From the delegate picker, **+ start new agent…** (or `n`) opens a short wizard:

1. **Agent type** — from `[[delegate.agents]]` (name + `command` argv).
2. **Space (workspace)** — pick which herdr space gets the agent (current space
   is pre-selected).
3. **Working directory** — unique cwds from running agents, optional
   `default_cwd`, plus common paths; or **type path…** for a free-text path
   (`~` and `$HOME/` expand).

With `placement = "tab"` (default) the plugin creates a new tab labelled with
the issue key and runs the agent **in that tab’s single root pane** (so you get
one terminal, not a shell + agent split):

```sh
herdr tab create --workspace <space> --cwd <dir> --label <ISSUE-KEY> --no-focus
herdr pane run <root-pane> '<command...>'
herdr agent rename <root-pane> <issue-agent-id>
```

With `placement = "right"` or `"down"` it uses `herdr pane split <parent-pane>
--direction right|down --cwd <dir> --no-focus`, then `pane run` in the returned
pane. The parent is Jira's pane if it belongs to the selected workspace;
otherwise the focused pane (or first available pane) in that workspace.
`focus_new = true` uses `--focus` for either placement.

Then it waits `startup_delay_ms`, polls `agent get` until detection, and uses
`agent wait --until idle` before sending the rendered Jira prompt. Detection
and idle share a single `wait_ready_ms` budget. If readiness fails, the prompt
is **not sent** and an error is shown. `wait_ready_ms = 0` explicitly disables
this check; it is not recommended for cold agent starts.
